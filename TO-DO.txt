Things to do or clarify:

1. Fitness scores- why are so many amino acids missing values in fitness_variance_heatmap.png ?
2. Wild Type sequence- seems to be missing a stop codon (toss_outliers_v2.py, create_mat_barcode_fit_dic.py)
	- fixed this on 11/11/2014, but can someone double check that this is the correct sequence? are there other files where this sequence is present?
